# Snivyer's bot

An open source basic fun bot, thanks to my friend Reperak for providing some of the code to get started with it

## Making a command

1. Create a Python file in the [command folder](commands)
2. Write the command inside [a cog](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/cogs.html)
3. Register your command in [cogregister.py](cogregister.py)

## Colaborating
If you want to colaborate send PRs here please, any PR to main or any other branch will be automatically rejected

## Dependencies

I have no fucking idea what dependencies I'm using, if you get errors when trying to run the bot try installing any missing dependencies from pip.
yes, pip is requiered because I'm not making a tutorial on how to install dependencies for python manually

## Lastly

I don't know what to do with this anymore, if you got any ideas make an issue as a feature request and I might check it out
for now this is all I'll do until I get more ideas
