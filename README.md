# Snivyer's bot
An open source basic fun bot based out of Waffle from Reperak and also some of his own bot

## Making a command
1. Create a Python file in the [command folder](commands)
2. Write the command inside [a cog](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/cogs.html)
3. Register your command in [cogregister.py](cogregister.py)

## Colaborating
If you want to colaborate send PRs here please, any PR to main or any other branch will be automatically rejected

## One More Thing, Depencies
I have no fucking idea what dependencies I'm using, if you get errors when trying to run the bot try installing any missing dependencies from pip
yes, pip is requiered because I'm not making a tutorial on how to install dependencies for python manually
